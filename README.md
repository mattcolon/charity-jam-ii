# Charity Jam II: Brawler+

This is my submission to Games for Love's [Charity Jam II](https://itch.io/jam/charity-jam-ii), whose theme is "Brawler+," combining the brawler genre with another core genre and other genre addons.

My submission combines the brawler genre with the stress-management cooking genre a la Overcooked, with some arcade elements as well.  Players spend their time quickly assembling meals while fending off rival gang members who are trying to stop them from succeeding.
